			The MCEdit unified project was born out of the community wanting to revive the aging program after Codewarrior had 
			moved on to MCEdit 2, and since has gained a small, but dedicated team, even so anyone wanting to contribute is welcome.
			<br><br>Note: We are not directly affiliated with Codewarrior, and due to the nature of a community driven open source project
			we don't accept donations. Any money sent to Codewarrior won't be received here.

			MCEdit is a versatile map utility, designed for editing Minecraft maps. With it, you can open a level 
			and fly around in glorious 3D with multiple levels of detail! Select millions of blocks 
			and clone them anywhere else in the level. Fill a boxy selection with the block of your choice, or 
			replace one kind of block with another. Export blocks to a <i>schematic</i> file for later use. 
			Import a schematic or an entire level into any world using import. Move players, spawn points, or even add and delete players. 
			Create and and remove chunks from the world. Fill blackened areas with light. And much more with modular
			<i>Filters</i>!

			movement keys (defaults: <span style="font-weight: bold">WASDShiftSpace</span>) to move the related item around. Hold Right Click to nudge further.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you have a powerful computer, press
			Control-F to see farther.
		</p>
		<h2 id="Selection">Selection Tools</h2>
		<p>
			Mark a selection using blue and yellow cubes. Here is a selection in progress.
			<br>
			<img src="images/Selection0.png" class="simg" alt="Image">
		</p>
		<p>
			A completed selection.
			<br>
			<img src="images/Selection1.png" class="simg" alt="Image">
			<br>The selection tool can also be used to export schematics and do some other basic tasks.
		</p>
		<h2 id="Brush">Brush Tool:</h2>
		<p>
			The brush tool allows you to "Paint" the world using preset shapes, you can use RFEG to Increase size, Decrease size, rotate and roll this tool. 
			<img src="images/brush0.png" class="simg" alt="Image">
			<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Hold Z after placing a brush and click a second point to create a solid line of that brush. Line spacing adjusts how close together brushes are.
			<img src="images/brush0.png" class="simg" alt="Image">
			<br>
		</p>
		<h2 id="Clone">Clone Tool:</h2>
		<p>
			Quickly copy blocks within the same level. The selected blocks are cloned into the green box and will
			follow your cursor around until you click. Click the green selection again to pick it back up.
			<br>
			<img src="images/clone0.png" class="simg" alt="Image">
		</p>
		<p>
			Use the keys <span style="font-weight: bold">E R F G</span> to rotate, roll, flip, and mirror a cloned structure.

		</p>
		<p>
			Once you are happy with the clone's location, click <strong>Clone</strong> or press <strong>Enter</strong> to apply, a selection will appear over the cloned area when complete.
			<br>
			<img src="images/clone1.png" class="simg" alt="Image">
		</p>
		<h2 id="Fill">Fill Tool:</h2>
		<p>
			Pretty self-explanatory, fills the selected area with the chosen block. Can also replace certain blocks.
			<br>
			<img src="images/replace.png" class="simg" alt="Image">
		</p>
		<h2 id="Crane">Import tool:</h2>
		<p>
			The import tool lets you import blocks from different sources: It can place blocks previously saved using the select tool to a schematic.
			It can also import an entire level into another level. It will ask you to choose a level or schematic. After you've chosen, 
			the level or schematic will appear in the green box. Although it may take a few seconds to display the 
			contents of the import, it is fully loaded and can be placed without waiting for everything to render.

			<br>Here, I've placed
			<a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=23&amp;t=13796" class="postlink">the destroyed city.</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			As before, you can click to pick the blocks up, and use <span style="font-weight: bold">E R F </span> to rotate, roll, and flip them.
			<br>
			<a href="images/crane1.jpg">
				<img src="images/crane1.jpg" class="simg" alt="Image">

		</p>
		<p>
			Press ENTER or click <span style="font-weight: bold">Import</span> to construct. Constructions of up to 64 million blocks should take less than a minute. The copy is done once you regain control. You should press Control-S to save your level now. The lighting recalculation for this city took about 3 minutes on a Core i5.
			<br>
			<a href="images/crane2.jpg">
				<img src="images/crane2.jpg" class="simg" alt="Image">

		</p>
		<p>
			Et voila.<br>

				<img src="http://img413.imageshack.us/img413/4492/voila.jpg" class="simg" alt="Image">
			</a>
		</p>
		<h2 id="Chunk">Chunk tool:</h2>
		<p>
			<img src="images/chunk.jpg" alt="Image">
			<br>
			When you pick the Chunk tool, the visible selection is
			automatically expanded to cover all of the chunks it touches. Press <span style="font-style: italic">Create</span> to create all missing chunks in the selection, ignoring any chunks already present. Press <span style="font-style: italic">Destroy</span> to remove any chunks within the selection. Use <span style="font-style: italic">Prune</span> to keep all of the chunks in the selection, and delete the ones outside. All of these will ask you for confirmation because there's no way to undo them.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, you can press <span style="font-style: italic">Relight</span> to fix any bad lighting within the selected chunks. If other programs leave your level full of black spots, you can fix it with this.

		<span id="Spawn"></span>

			<h2>Download</h2>
			<a href="https://github.com/khroki/MCEdit-Unified/releases" class="postlink">
				Click here for downloads
			</a>
		</div>

		<br><br>
		Open and save the following formats, compressed or non:

		<p>
			-Alpha/Beta/Release PC version Maps (level.dat + folders)
		</p>

		<p>
			-Classic Indev (*.mclevel)
		</p>

		<p>
			-Classic Creative/Survival (*.mine, server_level.dat) **
		</p>


		** If your Classic level fails to load, or loads with the blocks all
		out of order, put the dimensions of the map into the filename, e.g.
		server_level_256_256_128.dat.
		<br>


		Import schematics created by MCEdit, schematics created by Redstone Simulator, and
		inventory files created by INVEdit. (as chests!)

		<br>
		<br>
		Make backups!

		<br>
		<br>
		Report any bugs to the <a href="https://github.com/Khroki/MCEdit-Unified/issues/new">GitHub Issues</a> page.

		<h2>Caveats</h2>
		<p>
			After increasing the window size, mouse input no longer works correctly.
			<br>
			Restart MCEdit to fix this.
		</p>
		<p>
			Support for non-English computers and foreign character sets is shaky. For best results,
			put the MCEdit folder directly into your C:\
		</p>
		<p>
			Creating and deleting chunks will save them to disk or delete them immediately.
		</p>
		<p>
			Cannot resize finite levels.
		</p>
		<p>
			Many tiles are replaced when converting from the older maps to Minecraft Alpha maps.  All cloth tiles are bleached white and any "Infinite" liquids are replaced with still liquids.
		</p>
		<p>
			The conversion also works the other way:  Blocks introduced since Alpha are converted to white cloth when moved to a Classic level. There is no way to control which blocks are replaced during a conversion.
		</p>
		<p>
			There is no conversion between the old Indev and the older Creative/Survival.
			<br>
			Take caution when copying between them.
		</p>
		<p>
			Classic levels require their dimensions to be in the file name, or else MCEdit will attempt to guess them based on the file's size.
