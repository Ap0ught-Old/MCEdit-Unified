# We got a kinda wonky setup here.
# Unfortunately, I named both this package leveldb_mcpe and
# the wrapper leveldb_mcpe.
# By making this a proper package and making the wrapper a member
# of the package, it at least works, although it is kinda wonky.

# Maybe someday, rename one of the 2 and sort out all the issues.
import leveldb_mcpe
