LEVELDB_MCPE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR LINUX SYSTEMS
========================================================

In order to install this library, you will run the setup.py file.

Since the library is compiled against Boost, Mojang's leveldb-mcpe and
Python 2.7, you will need these dependencies.

Ensure you're connected to internet. Somes packages need to be
downloaded.


~~~~~~~~~~~~
DEPENDENCIES
~~~~~~~~~~~~

BINARIES
~~~~~~~~

These binaries/tools have to be installed on system in order to compile
leveldb_mcpe:

* g++
* make
* tar
* unzip


BOOST 1.55.0 STATIC BOOST_PYTHON
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Boost 1.55.0 static boost_python is needed to compile leveldb_mcpe.
This specific build will be installed automatically (if not found) for
the user only. This mean that, if '~/.local/lib/boost_1_55_0_mcpe' is
not found, Boost will be installed there.

You have nothing to do.

If you run again the setup.py script, and Boost is found, it won't be
reinstalled.


MOJANG'S LEVELDB-MCPE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Like Boost, this library will be installed if not found.
It will be installed in '~/.local/lib/leveldb-mcpe'.


PYTHON 2.7 HEADERS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unfortunately, no solution to build Boost and leveldb_mcpe
against a user specific install of Python header was found (for now).

You'll have to install them on you system with you package manager...


~~~~~~~~~~~~
INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just run 'python setup.py build' et voil√†!
